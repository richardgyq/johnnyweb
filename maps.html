<p>Maps are the levels you play on and each has a different course or path. There could be a straight line all the way through one map and another could just be lots of turns. There also could be obstcales, which are things blocking your path that can be removed by paying money. maps have different diffculties such as easy, medium and hard. After beating a map you can play the different modes too. Once beating easy you get sandbox and primary only. For medium Reverse and millitary only then Apopalypse. For hard magic only, alternate bloons rounds and sandbox then Impoppable. </p>
