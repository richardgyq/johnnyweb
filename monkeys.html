For tier 4 is the juggernaut, and makes it so it shoots a giant spiked ball which is also able to pop lead and can pierce 101 bloons. The ultra juggernaut hurls a giant spiked ball that slits into 6 smaller balls and can pierce 1614 bloons. In path 2 his first upgrade is quick shots and makes it so he shoots 15% faster. Then is very quick shots which makes it so it shots 33% faster. Triple darts make it shoot 3 darts. Super monkey fan club is an ability that makes makes up to 10 dart monkeys including itself into super monkeys for 10 seconds. Elite monkey fan club makes up to 15 dart monkeys into plasma super monkeys for 10 seconds. In path 3 the first upgrade is longer range which increases range.
