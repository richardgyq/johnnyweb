        <p>Bloons are your main enemy in the game. They will follow a certain path and try to go through the exit. In the corner of your sceen you will notice a number of hearts, for every bloon that goes through you lose one. If it hits zero you lose. Some bloons are slow, while others are fast. More importantly though, most bloons have multiple layers. blue bloons have 2 layers, green 3, yellow 4,etc. Also there are special properties such as camo, black, purple, white, lead, regrow and moab class bloons.</p>

        <h2>Bloons</h2>
        <p>There are many diferent types of bloons, red bloons have one layer which means it only needs to be hit once. Depending on the amount of layers is how many hits are needed to pop it. Blue bloons have 2  layers so it needs to be hit twice. Green 3 times, yellow 4 and pink 5 and are really fast. Next are black, purple and white bloons. These bloons all have the same amount of bloons two pink bloons. The only difference with them are their properties. Black bloons can't be exploded(except for frags). Purple bloons can only be popped by physical projectials such as darts, shurikens, bombs, boomerangs, tacks, ice, glue etc also are fast. White bloons can't be frozen. Lead bloons are a type of bloon that only certain types of attacks can pop and is really slow. It also contain two black bloons. Next are zebra bloons that have both the properties of black and white bloons, also it contains a black bloon with a white one. One of the more diffcult bloons are the rainbow bloons. It contains two zebra bloons and moves fast. Finally are ceramics. Ceramics have a shell that can take ten hits before it pops and releases 2 rainbow bloons and are also fast.</p>
        
        <h2>Camo</h2>
        <p>Camo bloons are camoflaged with the background so that only certain monkeys can spot them. Any bloon can be camoflaged including lead bloons. Camo lead bloons are one of the hardest bloons to pop since not a lot of monkeys can pop lead and camo. If they can pop them then they need a lot of upgrades. Some moab class bloons are also camo.</p>

        <h2>Regrow</h2>
        <p>Regrow bloons are bloons that can grow back into their largest state. If they were originally rainbow but were poped to red they could regrow all the way back to rainbow. Regrow bloons are really deadly when dealing with big bloons such as ceramics. Popping a regrow ceramic will actually take more lives than just letting it in normally.</p>

        <h2>Moabs</h2>
        Moabs are the most diffucult type of bloon and carry lots of bloons. A normal moab contains 4 ceramics and bigger moabs contain more normal moabs. BFB contain 4 normal moabs and ZOMG contain 4 BFBs.
